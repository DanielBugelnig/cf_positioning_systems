# crazyflies-positioning
## Commissioning and testing of localization systems for mini-drones

This project aims to set up and use Crazyflie with the loco positioning system to enable autonomous flight.
Furthermore, the preciseness and accuracy will be compared with the optitrack motion-capturing positioning system.
